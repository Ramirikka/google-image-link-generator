# Google Image Links Generator
Python script that generates Google Image Search links from a list of keywords

Description:

This Python script is a tool that converts a list of keywords into Google Image Search links. It takes a list of keywords as input and generates a set of links that can be used to search for images related to those keywords on Google.

Instructions:

Create an input file containing a list of keywords, with each keyword on a new line. For example:
apple
banana
cherry

Save the input file as a text file (e.g. input.txt) in the same directory as the Python script.

Open the Python script in a Python IDE or text editor.

In the script, edit the values of the input_file_path and output_file_path variables to match the names and locations of your input and output files.

Run the script. It will read in the list of keywords from the input file, generate a set of Google Image Search links based on those keywords, and write the links to the output file.

Open the output file (e.g. output.txt) to view the generated links.

Note: By default, the generated links include the Google Images search options "&tbm=isch" which stands for "Image Search". If you want to customize your search parameters further, you can modify the "prefix" and "suffix" variables in the Python script.
